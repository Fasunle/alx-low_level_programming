# Function Nested Loops

Learning about loops in C programming language

_putchar: I encontered double inclusion error -> thanks to betty formatter which informed me of this error
	- solution: I used #ifndef MAIN_H and #define MAIN_H
	- this means that the file will only be inported once

	- it turns out that the gcc compile could not compile. So I ignore the betty error
